# Performance_Analysis
This project is my first analysis of company performance using Power BI, comparing Year-To-Date (YTD) and Period-To-Date (PTD) metrics to assess the company's sales and profitability trends over time. The dataset includes detailed sales, account, and product hierarchy information.


### Key Insights
1. **Sales Analysis**: Analyze the total sales for the company over different time periods.
2. **Profitability**: Compare the cost of goods sold (COGS) and gross profit margins for YTD and PTD.
3. **Product Performance**: Understand which product families, groups, and specific products contribute most to sales and profit.
4. **Geographic Insights**: Use account location data to assess the performance of different regions (Canada, China, Argentina, etc.).

### Data Sources

The project uses two main files:
1. **Plant_DTS.xlsx**: A comprehensive dataset with detailed sales, account, and product hierarchy data.
   - **Plant_FACT**: Contains sales transactions, product details, quantities, prices, and COGS.
   - **Accounts**: Provides information about customers, including location details such as country, postal code, and street address.
   - **Plant_Hierarchy**: Describes the hierarchical structure of products, including their family, group, and type.
   
2. **Company_Performance.pbix**: A Power BI report where the analysis is performed. The report includes various measures to calculate and visualize Year-To-Date (YTD) vs Period-To-Date (PTD) metrics for sales, gross profit, and quantity sold.


### Performance Metrics

- **Sales (USD)**: Total revenue generated from product sales.
- **Quantity Sold**: Number of units sold across different product categories.
- **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: Direct costs incurred to produce the products.
- **Gross Profit**: Revenue minus COGS, representing the profitability of sales.

### Insights to Explore

1. **Which products and regions have the highest sales volume and profit margins?**
2. **How do the current period's sales compare with the same period in previous years?**
3. **Which customers or accounts contribute the most to overall sales?**

### Recommendations

This is my first BI project and no doubt there is a lot to improve; please go ahead and reach out with your suggestions so I can do better and grow.

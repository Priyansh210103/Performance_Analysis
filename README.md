# Performance_Analysis
This project is my first analysis of company performance using Power BI, comparing Year-To-Date (YTD) and Period-To-Date (PTD) metrics to assess the company's sales and profitability trends over time. The dataset includes detailed sales, account, and product hierarchy information.
